Description
This project focuses on building a fully functional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain
and the free Gemini API. Students will design a dataset pipeline, embed documents, build retrievers, and create an
interactive QA/chat interface. The project also requires deployment, evaluation, and documentation through a
GitHub repository and a Medium-style article.


Deliverables
1. GitHub repository with full code and README instructions
2. Deployed demo link (Streamlit or Gradio)
3. Evaluation report with metrics and example outputs
4. Medium blog post explaining dataset, model, and results
Tools:
You can get Gemini’s API free from Google AI Studio and you can make free accounts on vector db


Task 1: Medical RAG QA System
Problem:
Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain that answers medical questions using
a publicly available clinical or biomedical dataset. The system should retrieve context-sensitive chunks and
generate accurate, citation-aware responses.

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions

Objective:
To create a safe medical assistant capable of retrieving evidence-based information and producing grounded
answers using LangChain retrievers and the Gemini API.
Deliverables:
• Preprocessed dataset with chunks and metadata.
• FAISS/Chroma vector store creation script.
• RAG pipeline (Retriever + Gemini LLM chain).
• Streamlit/Gradio medical QA demo.
• Evaluation on at least 30 medical queries.
Task 2: Policy Compliance Checker RAG System
Problem:
Build a LangChain-based RAG system that evaluates whether a given set of company policies, security protocols, or
HR manuals comply with predefined rules. The system should provide context-based evidence and suggestions for
corrections.
Dataset:
https://www.atticusprojectai.org/cuad
Objective:
To develop a compliance-checking agent that uses retrieval to inspect documents and determine whether each rule
is satisfied, providing evidence and remediation steps.
Deliverables:
• Rule definition file (minimum 15 rules).
• PDF ingestion + vector store pipeline.
• Custom compliance-checker tool connected to Gemini.
• Agent workflow for multi-step compliance questioning.
• Comparison table of compliant vs non-compliant sections.
