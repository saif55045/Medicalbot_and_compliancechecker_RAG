## 🏥 Task 1: Medical RAG QA System Evaluation

### 1. Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Total Queries Evaluated** | 30 |
| **Success Rate** | 100.0% |
| **Average Response Time** | 1.10 seconds |
| **Fastest Response** | 0.31 seconds |
| **Slowest Response** | 2.11 seconds |

### 2. Response Analysis

The system was tested with 30 diverse medical questions covering symptoms, procedures, and treatments.

**Sample Successful Query:**
> **Query:** What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis?
> **Response:** Based on the context, the symptoms of allergic rhinitis include increased nasal congestion and drainage. Please consult a doctor for professional advice.
> **Time:** 1.28s

**Longest Processing Query:**
> **Query:** Treatment for depression?
> **Time:** 2.11s

### 3. Latency Distribution
- **< 2s**: 29 queries
- **2s - 5s**: 1 queries
- **> 5s**: 0 queries

## 🛡️ Task 2: Policy Compliance Checker Evaluation

### 1. System Configuration
- **Rules Engine**: 15 predefined security rules.
- **Document Source**: Policy PDF documents.
- **Evaluation Method**: Rule-based semantic search + LLM verification.

### 2. Compliance Rules Coverage
The system evaluates policies against the following categories:
1. Data Security
2. Access Control
3. Password Policy
4. Acceptable Use
5. Remote Work
6. Incident Response
7. Software Installation
8. Data Retention
9. Physical Security
10. Social Media
11. Email Security
12. Clean Desk Policy
13. Vendor Management
14. Training
15. Mobile Devices

### 3. Qualitative Assessment
- **Accuracy**: The system uses semantic search to find relevant policy sections before making a determination, reducing hallucinations.
- **Evidence**: Every compliance check provides a direct quote from the source document.
- **Remediation**: Non-compliant items are accompanied by actionable remediation steps generated by the LLM.


## 🏁 Conclusion
Both systems meet the project requirements. The Medical QA system provides fast, context-aware answers, while the Compliance Checker offers a structured audit workflow. The integration of FAISS and Gemini 2.0 Flash ensures both speed and response quality.
